## Arrays

An array is a contiguous ordered sequence of elements; each element is an object, and all the elements of an array are of the same type

## Strings
A string is defined as "a contiguous sequence of characters terminated by and including the first null character"

## Pointers
Pointers  allow you to manipulate data stored in memory addresses. You can declare, initialize, dereference, and change the value pointed by pointers
