# In C programming, "file I/O" stands for file input/output. It refers to the mechanisms provided by the language to perform operations on files, including reading from and writing to them. File I/O is crucial for handling data persistence, such as reading from or writing to files on disk.

## Here are the main functions and concepts related to file I/O in C:

* File Pointers:

File pointers are used to navigate through a file. Common file pointers are FILE structures in C.

* Opening a File:

The fopen function is used to open a file. It returns a file pointer.

* Closing a File:

The fclose function is used to close a file.

* Reading from a File:

Functions like fgetc, fgets, fread are used to read data from a file.

* Writing to a File:

Functions like fputc, fputs, fwrite are used to write data to a file.

* Formatted Input/Output:

Functions like fprintf and fscanf provide formatted input/output similar to printf and scanf.

* Error Handling:

Functions like feof (end-of-file) and ferror are used for error handling.

* File Positioning:

Functions like fseek and ftell are used to set or get the current file position.

### File I/O is essential for working with external data, configuration files, and persisting program state. Proper error handling and file closure are crucial to ensure the reliable and secure handling of files in a C program.
